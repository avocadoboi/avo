# AvoGUI

AvoGUI is a light, modern framework for desktop applications written in C++20.

The framework was initially written in C++17, but now it is being rewritten from scratch in C++20 and with a better design that is less object oriented.

Currently, only GCC supports all C++20 features used in the library. There are also some features that are not used yet because no compiler or standard library supports them.

## Aims and features

* A modern design that allows creative coding and interactive programs yet is scalable for writing larger applications. 
* Interfaces are hard to misuse and as many errors as possible are catched at compile time.
* Library code follows C++ Core Guidelines.
* Written with modules when build systems and compilers have good support for modules.
* Support for Windows, Linux and MacOS.
* UTF-8 support.
* Free from warnings with all useful warning flags turned on.
* Modern CMake integration.
