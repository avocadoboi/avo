# Contributing 
Any contributions are greatly appreciated! The project is still in initial development, and pretty much any improvement is good, no matter how much has to be changed. I want to change things to improve things. Please open an issue if you have any questions or have any suggestions, and feel free to make pull requests to propose changes to the library. Every contribution has value. 

There are currently no guidelines, but trying to keep the style in line with the rest of the code is appreciated. Contributors are recommended to be aware of the C++ Core Guidelines since the project aims to follow most of them.

Building with CMake should be straight-forward, so please let me know if you encounter problems.

# Collaboration
This project is quite big and I have been working on it alone for some time now. I would be happy to find someone who wants to collaborate with me. If you find this project interesting and are relatively experienced with modern C++, please contact me! My Discord tag is **Avocado boi#1355**.
